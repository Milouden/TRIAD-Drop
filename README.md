## 🔍 Overview
TRIAD-Drop is an end-to-end framework that predicts student dropout risk in distance learning by integrating:
- **RAG-enhanced sentiment analysis** grounded in pedagogical knowledge
- **Prompt-engineered academic stress detection**
- **Cross-modal attention fusion** of behavioral, demographic, and affective signals
- **Source-cited intervention recommendations**

Achieves **89% accuracy** and **40% lower calibration error** than traditional models on real-world datasets.

## 📦 Dataset
Uses augmented version of the [Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) dataset:
- Original: 4,423 students, 36 features
- Augmented: Synthetic student comments generated via GPT-4.5
- Features: Socio-demographics, academic performance, forum comments

```python
# Sample synthetic comment generation
prompt = f"As a {age}-year-old {gender} student with GPA {gpa}, write forum post about {course}"
synthetic_comment = gpt4.generate(prompt)
```

## 🛠 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TRIAD-Drop.git
cd TRIAD-Drop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Train model**:
```python
from triad import TriadModel
model = TriadModel()
model.train("data/augmented_dataset.csv")
```

2. **Generate interventions**:
```python
risk_report = model.predict(student_profile)
print(risk_report.rationale)
# "At week 5: 'I feel isolated' → FAQ §3.1 → Risk 0.78 → Suggest mentorship"
```

3. **Export dashboard**:
```bash
python -m triad.visualize export_dashboard
```
